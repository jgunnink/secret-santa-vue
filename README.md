# Secret Santa - in Vue!

> A port of the rails app, SecretSanta

This application is an attempt at making a serverless application of the rails application which I made 18 months ago. It uses:

* Vue as the front-end
* Typescript for javascript based requirements
* Jest (and chai assertion library) for testing.
* Vue Bootstrap for componentry.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
